PowerMoves Development - ps-realtor (Forked)
A modified version of ps-realtor specifically adapted for the PowerMoves Development Government System and its enhanced property management.

‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER & WARNING ‚ö†Ô∏è
This repository contains a FORKED and MODIFIED version of the original ps-realtor script. It is designed to work EXCLUSIVELY with the pm-government system developed by PowerMoves Development and its associated ps-housing fork. We strongly advise against using this fork as a standalone replacement for your standard ps-realtor script or integrating it with other non-PowerMoves Development government systems, as it contains specific database and logic changes that may cause incompatibilities or errors.

‚ú® Key Modifications for pm-government Integration
This fork includes essential changes to support the advanced government and taxation features planned for pm-government, particularly concerning property creation and management. The primary modifications are:

Property Field Management:
Expanded Property Creation: ps-realtor has been modified to allow realtors to define and assign additional critical fields during property creation and listing:

property_type (TEXT): Categorizes properties (e.g., 'residential', 'commercial', 'agricultural', 'industrial'). This is set by the realtor via the ps-realtor interface.

owner_type (TEXT): Categorizes the owning entity ('citizen', 'company', 'government'). This is also set by the realtor via the ps-realtor interface.

is_tax_exempt Support: While ps-realtor's interface does not directly set the is_tax_exempt flag, its database interactions are updated to support this new column. The is_tax_exempt status is ALWAYS set MANUALLY by a Property Assessor via the pm-government tablet, based on roleplay justification. It is NOT automatically set by owner_type or any other factor.

Integration with pm-government System:
The data captured and managed by ps-realtor (specifically property_type and owner_type) is crucial for pm-government's internal property tracking, taxation calculations, and various legislative processes, including determining voter eligibility based on property ownership.
